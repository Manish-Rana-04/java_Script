"let" keyword is prefered to declare any variable instead of the "var" keyword because of the problem of js like block scope
 and functional scope .

"console.table([ ])" is used to print multiple value in table format .

"use strict;" is used to treat all js code as a newer version  - Good practice .

" alert (3+3)  "   it gives error in node.js but in browser it's output is 6 different syntex in node.js.

**** Data type
    1  number => 2 to power 53
    2  bigInt
    3  boolean = True/False
    4  string= ""
    5  undefined 
    6  null=  standalone value
    7  symbol= used for uniqueness in figma like 

*** "typeof()"  print the type of parameter
   
   typeof(undefined)=======undefined;
   typeof(null)============object;


Conversion to number 
   "55" => 55
   "rana" => NaN (not a number)
   true => 1 ;   false => 0

conversion to boolean  
    "" => 0
    "rana" => 1
    0 => false
    1 => true
    423 => true

conversion to string 
    33 = 33   // but now this 33 is string
    true= true // "


********Operation 

    "3" + 3 = 33      //  number to string
    "1" + 2 + 2 = 122   
    2 + 2 + "1" = 41   // first perform add operation then convert result to string

    +true = 1
    +false = 0

**************************
   == equality operator and the comperasion operatoe (>= , <= ,< , > )  works different in js.
   null>=0   =>   it gives true because it convert null to 0;
   the output is unpredictable sometimes in such type of comperision .

   "strict equalto " === is used to equality check with same data type .
